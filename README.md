# Online Proctoring System

A real-time proctoring system with AI-powered monitoring capabilities, built using React and Python.

## Overview

This project implements an online examination proctoring system that uses computer vision and machine learning to ensure exam integrity. It consists of a React-based frontend and a Python backend with YOLOv8 for real-time monitoring.

## Features

- **Real-time Video Monitoring**: Webcam-based student activity tracking
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Using YOLOv8 for object and behavior detection
- **Secure Session Management**: Unique candidate identification system
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Modern UI built with React and Tailwind CSS
